     Analyze the provided weekly inventory events, considering:
        * Identify Stockout/Near-Stockout Events:
            * Analyze the provided weekly inventory events to pinpoint specific weeks where stockout or near-stockout situations occurred, considering both reactive and proactive inventory levels.
            * Specifically, examine weeks where ending inventory levels dropped significantly or approached zero.
            * Use the provided data to quantify the severity of these events.
            * Proactively suggest potential root causes for these events, based on the provided data. Explain the root cause in detail using the data provided.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
        * Analyze Consumption Patterns:
            * Detail and explain the consumption patterns in the identified critical weeks.
            * Correlate consumption with the provided distribution source (probability distribution identified) and assess if there are any significant deviations from the expected behavior.
            * Calculate and present the variance in consumption week to week.
            * Quantify the difference between forecasted and actual consumption. Actual consumption is the simulated consumption based on the fixed or distribution identified and forecasted consumption is using the forecasting models. 
            * Consider that consumption type is: {consumption_type}. If consumption type is Distribution, the distribution parameters were: {consumption_distribution_params} and the probability distribution it follows is {consumption_best_distribution}. Explain how the distribution parameters affected the consumption, if applicable.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
        * Evaluate Inventory Levels:
            * Compare reactive and proactive inventory levels in the critical weeks.
            * Determine the impact of reactive and proactive orders on preventing or mitigating stockouts.
            * Calculate the time between order and arrival for both reactive and proactive orders.
            * Consider the lead time was {lead_time} with a standard deviation of {lead_time_std_dev}.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
        * Proactive vs. Reactive Inventory:
            * Based on the data, explicitly demonstrate the advantages of proactive inventory ordering over reactive ordering.
            * Quantify the differences in inventory levels and stockout occurrences between the two strategies.
            * Explain how the provided forecasted consumption data could have been better used.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
        * Inventory Policy Recommendations:
            * Provide specific, data-driven recommendations for inventory policies to prevent future stockouts for the given sequence of events.
            * Suggest optimal reorder points, safety stock levels, and order quantities for both reactive and proactive inventory for the given data or how the order placement should have been done better.
            * Recommend adjustments to the forecasting method based on the observed consumption patterns.
            * Recommend a policy that accounts for the variation in the consumption.
            * Recommend a value in which initial inventory should have started off to prevent stockouts. Reason the math mildly.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
        * Ordering Strategy Improvements:
            * Analyze the current ordering strategy and identify its weaknesses.
            * Suggest improvements to the timing and frequency of orders, considering the lead times and consumption variability.
            * Recommend if the reorder point should be changed, and by how much. The reorder point used was {reorder_point}.
            * Consider that order quantity type is: {order_quantity_type}. If order quantity type is Distribution, the distribution parameters were: {order_distribution_params} and the distribution it followed is {order_distribution_best}. Explain how the order distribution parameters affected the order quantity, if applicable.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
        * Summary of Key Insights and Recommendations:
            * Provide a concise summary of the key insights derived from the data.
            * Present a clear and actionable list of recommendations to optimize inventory management and prevent future stockouts.
            * Include the calculated variance of consumption, and the calculated lead times, and the calculated difference between forecasted and actual consumption in the summary.
            * ONLY use the data provided in the weekly events to support your analysis. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions.
    Do not include any introductory phrases or preambles. 
    Each section should have multiple bullet points, and each bullet point may contain more than one sentence where necessary to ensure clarity and depth in the analysis.
